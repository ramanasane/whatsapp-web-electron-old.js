# whatsapp-web-electron.js

A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app

It uses Puppeteer to run a real instance of Whatsapp Web to avoid getting blocked.

This is an electron wrapper for [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) which connect using [puppeteer-in-electron](https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/puppeteer-in-electron).

**NOTE:** I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.

## whatsapp-web.js Quick Links

* [Guide / Getting Started](https://wwebjs.dev/guide) _(work in progress)_
* [Reference documentation](https://docs.wwebjs.dev/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js)
* [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/whatsapp-web.js)

## Installation

The module is now available on [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/whatsapp-web-electron.js)! `npm i whatsapp-web-electron.js`

Please note that Node v12+ is required.

## Example usage

```js
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-core');
const pie = require('puppeteer-in-electron');
const { Client } = require('whatsapp-web-electron.js');

const window = new BrowserWindow({
    // your options...
});

pie.connect(app, puppeteer).then((pieBrowser) => {
    const client = new Client(pieBrowser, window);

    // No need to listen for "qr" event as you can scan
    // the qr code directly in electron window

    client.on('ready', () => {
        console.log('Client is ready!');
    });

    client.on('message', msg => {
        if (msg.body == '!ping') {
            msg.reply('pong');
        }
    });

    client.initialize();
});
```

Take a look at [whatsapp-web.js example.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/blob/master/example.js) for another example with more use cases. The only difference should be the initialization process and a few feature (explained below).

## Remote Access and Docker

The original [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) has remote access feature and supports docker which is irrelevant for an electron project, that's why I didn't include it here.

## Sending Arbitrary Image as Sticker

Sending image as sticker requires [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/releases) package and it's difficult to package with electron, so I choose to remove it. Feel free to open a PR if you can fix this issue.
